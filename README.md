Overview - 

In this assignment, I use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. I call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site. I chose cartoons for my theme.  

Instructions - 

By default, I created buttons for the following buttons:

Powerpuff Girls
Doug
Simpsons
Scooby Doo
Jetsons
Donald Duck
Looney Tunes
Batman
Duck Tales
Sponge Bob
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Inspector Gadget
Alvin and Chipmunks
My Little Pony
Smurfs

When the user clicks on any of buttons above, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.  When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing. Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).  This data is provided by the GIPHY API.

A form has been added to the page so it takes a value from a user input box and adds it to your topics array. When the users enters or adds a new cartoon in the "Add a cartoon" text box and clicks "Submit", a function is called to takes each new cartoon in the array and creates new buttons and a new cartoon button is appended on the page.
